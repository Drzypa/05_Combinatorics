\begin{document}
Let $G$ be a finite graph with $n$ vectices and let $D$ be the \PMlinkname{incidence matrix}{
IncidenceMatrixWithRespectToAnOrientation} of $G$ with respect to some orientation.
The \emph{Laplacian matrix} of $G$ is defined to be $DD^T$.

If we let $A$ be the adjacency matrix of $G$ then it can be shown
that $DD^T = \Delta - A$,
where $\Delta=\textrm{diag}(\delta_1, \ldots, \delta_n)$ and 
$\delta_i$ is the degree of
the vertex $v_i$. As a result, the Laplacian matrix is independent of what orientation is
chosen for $G$. 

The  Laplacian matrix is usually denoted by $L(G)$. It is a positive semidefinite
singular matrix, so that the   smallest eigenvalue is 0.
