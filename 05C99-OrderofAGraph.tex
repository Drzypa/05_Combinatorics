\begin{document}
The \emph{order} of a graph $G$ is the number of vertices in $G$; it is denoted by $|G|$. The same notation is used for the number of elements (cardinality) of a set. Thus, $|G| = |V(G)|$. We write $G^n$ for an \emph{arbitrary graph of order n}. Similarly, $G(n,m)$ denotes an \emph{arbitrary graph of order n and size m}.
