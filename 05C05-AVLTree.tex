\begin{document}
An \emph{AVL tree} is a balanced binary search tree where the height of the two
subtrees (children) of a node differs by at most one. Look-up, insertion, and
deletion are $O( \ln{n})$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree.

The structure is named for the inventors, Adelson-Velskii and Landis (1962).
