\begin{document}
A \emph{simple path} in a graph is a path $P=v_0 e_0 v_1\dots e_{n-1} v_n$
such that no vertex occurs twice in $P$. 
Some authors relax this condition by permitting $v_0=v_n$.  In this case the path is usually called a cycle.
%A \emph{simple path} in a graph is a path $v_0 e_0 v_1 e_1\dots e_{n-1} v_n$
%such that no vertex is repeated, except that possibly $v_0=v_1$.  In the latter %case, the simple path is called a cycle.
%A \emph{simple path} in a graph is a path that contains no vertex more than once.  
%By definition, cycles are particular instances of simple paths.
