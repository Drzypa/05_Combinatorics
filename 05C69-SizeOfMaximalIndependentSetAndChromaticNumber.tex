\begin{document}
Let $\alpha(G)$ be the size of the largest independent set in a graph $G$, and $\chi(G)$ the chromatic number of $G$.

{\bf Theorem:} $\alpha(G)\chi(G) \geq |G|$.

\bigskip

\begin{proof}
The vertices of $G$ can be partitioned into $\chi(G)$ monochromatic classes. Each class is an independent set, and hence cannot have size larger than $\alpha(G)$.
\end{proof}
