\paragraph{Theorem} Let $G$ be a graph.  If $M$ is a matching on $G$, and $C$ is an edge covering for $G$, then $|M| \leq |C|$.

\paragraph{Proof} Consider an arbitrary matching $M$ on $G$ and an arbitrary edge covering $C$ on $G$.  We will attempt to construct a one-to-one function $f: M \rightarrow C$.

Consider some edge $e \in M$.  At least one of the vertices that $e$ joins must be in $C$, because $C$ is an edge covering and hence every edge is incident with some vertex in $C$.  Call this vertex $v_e$, and let $f(e) = v_e$.

Now we will show that $f$ one-to-one.  Suppose we have two edges $e_1, e_2 \in M$ where $f(e_1) = f(e_2) = v$.  By the definition of $f$, $e_1$ and $e_2$ must both be incident with $v$.  Since $M$ is a matching, however, no more than one edge in $M$ can be incident with any given vertex in $G$.  Therefore $e_1 = e_2$, so $f$ is one-to-one.

Hence we now have that $|M| \leq |C|$.

\paragraph{Corollary} Let $G$ be a graph.  Let $M$ and $C$ be a matching and an edge covering on $G$, respectively.  If $|M| = |C|$, then $M$ is a maximal matching and $C$ is a minimal edge covering.

\paragraph{Proof} Suppose $M$ is not a maximal matching.  Then, by definition, there exists another matching $M'$ where $|M| < |M'|$.  But then $|M'| > |C|$, which violates the above theorem.

Likewise, suppose $C$ is not a minimal edge covering.  Then, by definition, there exists another covering $C'$ where $|C'| < |C|$.  But then $|C'| < |M|$, which violates the above theorem.
