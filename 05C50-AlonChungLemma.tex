\begin{document}
Let $G= (V,E)$ be a undirected graph of $n$ vertices such that the degree of each vertex is equal to $d$. Let $X$ be a subset of $V$. Then the number of edges in the subgraph induced by $X$ is at most
\[
\frac{1}{2n} \Big( d|X|^2 +  \lambda |X|(n- |X|) \Big)
\]
where $\lambda$ is the second largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of $G$.
