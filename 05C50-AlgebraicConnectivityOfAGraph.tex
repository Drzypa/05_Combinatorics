Let $L(G)$ be the \PMlinkname{Laplacian matrix}{LaplacianMatrixOfAGraph}
 of a finite connected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices. Let the eigenvalues
of $L(G)$ be denoted by
$\lambda_1 \le \lambda_2 \le \cdots \le \lambda_n$, which
is the usual notation in spectral graph theory.
The \emph{\PMlinkescapetext{algebraic} connectivity} of $G$ is $\lambda_2$.
The usual notation for the algebraic connectivity is $a(G)$.
The parameter is a measure of how well the graph is connected.
For example, $a(G) \not = 0$ if and only if $G$ is connected.
