The \emph{girth} of a graph $G$ is the length of the shortest cycle in $G$.\footnote{There is no widespread agreement on the girth of a forest, which has  no cycles.  It is also extremely unimportant.}

For instance, the girth of any grid $\Ints^d$ (where $d>2$) is 4, and the girth of the vertex graph of the dodecahedron is 5.
