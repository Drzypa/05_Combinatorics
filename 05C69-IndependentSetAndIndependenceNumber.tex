\begin{document}
A set of vertices in a graph $G$ is called an {\em independent set} if there are no edges between the vertices.

The {\em independence number} of a graph $G$, usually denoted by $\alpha(G)$, is the size of a maximal independent set in $G$. $\alpha(G) \geq \nu$ means that there are $\nu$ vertices with no edges between them.

An independent set is sometimes called a stable set or an anticlique.
