\begin{document}
Let $T$ be a tree with finite levels and an infinite number of elements.  Then consider the elements of $T_0$.  $T$ can be partitioned into the set of descendants of each of these elements, and since any finite partition of an infinite set has at least one infinite partition, some element $x_0$ in $T_0$ has an infinite number of descendants.  The same procedure can be applied to the children of $x_0$ to give an element $x_1\in T_1$ which has an infinite number of descendants, and then to the children of $x_1$, and so on.  This gives a sequence $X=\langle x_0, x_1,\ldots \rangle$. The sequence is infinite since each element has an infinite number of descendants, and since $x_{i+1}$ is always of child of $x_i$, $X$ is a branch, and therefore an infinite branch of $T$.
