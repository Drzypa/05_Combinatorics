{\bf Given} a Moore graph with diameter 2 and girth 5, which implies the
existence of cycles. {\bf To prove} every node (vertex) has the same valency,
$v$ say, and the number $n$ of nodes (vertices) is $v^2+1$.

{\bf Lemma:} a key feature of Moore graphs with diameter 2 is that any nodes X
and \PMlinkescapetext{Z} that are not adjacent have exactly one shared neighbour Y. {\bf Proof of lemma:} at least one Y$_k$ because distance XY is not 1 so must be 2, at most one because XY$_0$ZY$_1$ would be a 4-cycle.~\qed

{\bf Lemma:} every two adjacent nodes B and C lie together on some 5-cycle.
{\bf Proof of lemma:} every node (other than B) is at distance 1 or 2 from B, and every node (other than C) at distance 1 or 2 from C. There are no nodes X
at distance 1 from both (BXC would be a 3-cycle). Suppose the graph only has nodes at distance 1 from B and 2 from C (call them A$_i$), and nodes at distance 1 from C and 2 from B (call them D$_j$). Now no cycle can exist (the only edges are A$_i$B, BC, CD$_j$; any edge of type AA, AC, \PMlinkescapetext{AD}, BD, DD would create a 3-or 4-cycle). But Moore graphs have cycles by definition. So there must be at least one node E at distance 2 from both B and C. Let A be the joint neighbour of B and E, and D that of C and E (note A $\ne$ D, otherwise BAC would be a 3-cycle). Now CDEAB is a 5-cycle with edge BC.~\qed

{\bf Lemma:} two nodes O and Q at distance~2 have the same valency. {\bf Proof
of lemma:} let P be the unique joint neighbour. Let O have $o$ other neighbours
N$_i$ and let Q have $q$ other neighbours R$_j$.

No N$_i$ can be adjacent to P (3-cycle PON$_i$) so the unique joint neighbours
of any N$_i$ and Q must be among the R$_j$. Different N$_i$ and N$_{i'}$
cannot use the same R$_j$ (4-cycle ON$_i$R$_j$N$_{i'}$) so we have $o\le q$.
By the same argument (swapping O and Q, N$_i$ and R$_j$) also $q\le o$ so we
have $o=q$, both nodes have valency $q+1$.~\qed

{\bf Lemma:} two adjacent nodes O and S have the same valency. {\bf Proof
of lemma:} let OPQRS be the 5-cycle through SO. Calling the valency of Q
again $q+1$, both O and S have that same valency by the previous lemma.~\qed

{\bf Proof of theorem:} the graph is connected. Travel from any node to any
other via adjacent ones, the valency stays the same by the last lemma (let's
keep calling it $q+1$).

Now let N and R be any two adjacent nodes. N has $q$ other neighbours O$_i$
and R has $q$ other neighbours Q$_j$. Call the joint neighbour of O$_i$ and
Q$_j$ now P$_{ij}$, these $q^2$ nodes are all distinct (4-cycles of type
NOPO and/or RQPQ otherwise) and none of them coincide with N, R, the Os or Qs
(3- or 4-cycles otherwise). On the other hand, there are no further nodes
(distance $\gt2$ from N or R otherwise). Tally: $q^2+2q+2 = (q+1)^2+1$,
for valency $q+1$.~\qed
