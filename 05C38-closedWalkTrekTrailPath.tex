Graph theory terminology is notoriously variable so the following definitions should be used with caution. In books, most authors define their usage at the beginning.

In a graph, multigraph or even pseudograph $G$,
%
\begin{itemize}

\item a {\bf walk} of length $s$ is formed by a sequence of $s$ edges such
      that any two successive edges in the sequence share a vertex (aka node).
      The walk is also considered to include all the vertices (nodes) incident
      to those edges, making it a subgraph.

      In the case of a simple graph (i.e.\ not a multigraph) it is also
      possible to define the walk uniquely by the vertices it visits: a
      {\bf walk} of length $s$ is then a sequence of vertices $\nu_0$, 
      $\nu_1$, \dots\ $\nu_s$ such that an edge $\nu_i\nu_{i+1}$ exists
      for all $0\le i\lt s$. Again the walk is considered to contain those
      edges as well as the vertices.

\item A {\bf trek} is a walk that does not backtrack, i.e.\ 
      no two successive edges are the same.

      For simple graphs this also implies
      $\nu_i \ne \nu_{i+2}$ for all $0\le i\le s-2$.

\item A {\bf trail} is a walk where all edges are distinct, and

\item a {\bf path} is one where all vertices are distinct.

\end{itemize}
%
The walk, etc.\ is said to {\bf run from $\nu_0$ to $\nu_s$}, to {\bf run between} them, to {\bf connect} them etc. The term {\em trek\/} was introduced by Cameron~\cite{Cam94} who notes the lexicographic mnemonic
$$
  \hbox{\em paths\/}  \;\subset\;
  \hbox{\em trails\/} \;\subset\;
  \hbox{\em treks\/}  \;\subset\;
  \hbox{\em walks\/}
$$
The other terms are fairly widespread, cf.~\cite{Wil02}, but {\bf beware:} many authors call walks {\bf paths}, and some then call paths {\bf chains}. And when edges are called {\bf arcs}, a trek of length $s$ sometimes goes by the name
{\bf $s$-arc}.

Note that for the purpose of defining connectivity any of these types of wanderings can be used; if a walk exists between vertices $\mu$ and $\nu$ then there also exists a path between them. And here we must allow $s=0$ to make ``are connected by a path'' an equivalence relation on vertices (in order to define
connected components as its equivalence classes).
%
\begin{itemize}

\item A {\bf closed walk} aka {\bf circuit} of length $s\ne0$ is a walk where
      $\nu_0 = \nu_s$, 

\item a {\bf closed trek} is a trek that's closed in the same way, and 

\item a {\bf closed trail} likewise;

\item a {\bf closed path} aka ({\bf elementary}) {\bf cycle} is like a path
      (except that we only demand that $\nu_i$ for $0\le i\lt s$ are distinct)
      and again closed ($\nu_s$ again coincides with $\nu_0$).

\end{itemize}
%
{\bf Beware:} cycles are often called circuits~\cite{Cam94}; the distinction between circuits and cycles here follows Wilson~\cite{Wil02}. These closed wanderings are often called after their length: {\bf $s$-circuits}, {\bf $s$-cycles}.

The case $s=0$ is excluded from these definitions; $1$-cycles are loops so imply a pseudograph; $2$-cycles are double edges implying multigraphs; so $3$ is the minimum cycle length in a proper graph.

Note also that in trivalent aka cubic graphs a closed trail is automatically a closed path: it is impossible to visit a vertex (in via edge $a$, out via edge $b$ say) and visit it again (in via $c$, out via $d$) without also revisiting an edge, because there are only three edges at each vertex.
%
\begin{itemize}

\item An {\bf open walk}, {\bf open trek}, {\bf open trail} is one that isn't
      closed.

\item An {\bf open path} (sometimes {\bf open chain}) is just a path as
      defined above (because a closed path isn't actually a path). Still,
      the term is useful when you want to emphasise the contrast with a
      closed path.
