The contraharmonic mean of several positive numbers 
$u_1$, $u_2$, $\ldots$, $u_n$  is defined as
$$c \;:=\; \frac{u_1^2\!+\!u_2^2\!+\ldots+\!u_n^2}{u_1\!+\!u_2\!+\ldots+\!u_n}.$$                                        
This \PMlinkescapetext{concept} has certain applications; one 
of them is by [1] the following.

If $\langle u_1$, $u_2$, $\ldots$, $u_n\rangle$ is the distribution of the seats of $n$ parties, 
$s$ the total number of seats in the body of delegates 
($u_1\!+\!u_2\!+\ldots+\!u_n\,=\,s$), 
and one draws a random seat (with probability $1/s$), then the size of the drawn 
delegate{'}s party has the {\it expected value}
$$\frac{u_1}{s}\!\cdot\!u_1+\frac{u_2}{s}\!\cdot\!u_2+\ldots+\frac{u_n}{s}\!\cdot\!u_n 
\;=\; c.$$
