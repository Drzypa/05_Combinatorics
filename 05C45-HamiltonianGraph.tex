A graph $G$ is \emph{Hamiltonian} if it has a Hamiltonian cycle.

A useful condition both necessary and sufficient for a graph to be Hamiltonian is not known.  Ore's theorem and the Bondy and Chv\'atal theorem give sufficient conditions, while a necessary condition follows quickly from the definition, namely:

Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph of order at least 3. If $G$ is Hamiltonian, then for every proper subset $U$ of $V$, the subgraph induced by $V-U$ has at most $|U|$ components.
