Connectivity of graphs, when it isn't specified which flavor is intended, usually refers to {\em vertex connectivity\/}, unless it is clear from the context that it refers to {\em edge connectivity\/}.

The ({\bf vertex}) {\bf connectivity} $\kappa(G)$ is the minimum number of vertices (aka nodes) you have to remove to {\em either\/} make the graph no longer connected, {\em or\/} reduce it to a single vertex (node). $G$ is said to be {\bf $k$-}({\bf vertex}){\bf-connected} for any $k\le\kappa(G)\in\Nset$. Note that ``removing a vertex'' in graph theory also involves removing all the edges incident to that vertex.

The {\bf edge connectivity} $\kappa'(G)$ of a graph $G$ is more straightforward, it is just the minimum number of edges you have to remove to make the graph no longer connected. $G$ is said to be {\bf $k$-edge-connected} for any $k\le\kappa'(G)\in\Nset$. And note ``removing an edge'' is simply that; it does not entail removing any vertices.

\begin{itemize}

\item If $\kappa'(G)=0$ also $\kappa(G)=0$ and vice versa; such graphs are
      called disconnected and consist of several connected components.
      If $\kappa$ and $\kappa'$ are nonzero (the graph is 1-connected) it is
      a connected graph (a single connected component)

\item If $\kappa'(G)=1$ the graph contains at least one bridge. If 
      $\kappa'(G)\gt1$ (the graph is 2-edge-connected) every edge is 
      part of a cycle (circuit, closed path).

      If $\kappa(G)=1$ the graph contains at least one cutvertex. If 
      $\kappa(G)\gt1$ (the graph is 2-vertex-connected) there is, for 
      any pair of vertices, a cycle they both lie on.

\item For the complete graphs we have $\kappa(K_n)=\kappa'(K_n)=n-1$.

\item For any graph $G$ we have $\kappa(G) \le \kappa'(G) \le \delta(G)$
      where the latter is the minimum valency in $G$ (the valency of a
      vertex is the number of edges sprouting from it).

\end{itemize}

Everything on this page applies equally well to multigraphs and pseudographs.

For directed graphs there are 
\PMlinkname{two notions of connectivity}{ConnectedGraph} (``weak'' if the underlying graph is connected, ``strong'' if you can get {\em from\/} everywhere {\em to\/} everywhere).

There are now
\PMlinkname{pictures}{ExamplesOfKConnectedGraphs} to go with this entry.
