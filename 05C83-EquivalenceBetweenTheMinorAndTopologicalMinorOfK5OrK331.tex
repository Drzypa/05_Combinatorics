\begin{document}
A graph $ G $ contains $ K_5 $ or $ K_{3,3} $ as a minor iff it contains $ K_5 $ or $ K_{3,3} $ as a \PMlinkname{topological minor}{subdivision}. Where $ K_5$ is the complete graph of order 5 and $ K_{3,3}$ is the complete bipartite graph of order 6.

Remark that this theorem shows that Wagner's theorem and Kuratowski's theorem are equivalent.
