\subsection*{Moore graphs}

It is easy to see that if a graph $G$ has diameter $d$ (and has any cycles
at all), its girth $g$ can be no more than $2d+1$. For suppose $g\ge2d+2$ and
$O$ is a cycle of that minimum length $g$. Take two vertices (nodes) A and B
on $O$ that are $d+1$ steps apart along $O$, one way round; they are $g-(d+1)
\ge d+1$ steps apart the other way round. Now either there is no shorter
route between A and B (contradicting diameter $d$) or there is a shorter route
of length $r\lt d+1$ creating a cycle of length $d+1+r\lt 2d+2$
(contradicting girth $g$).

{\bf Definition}: A {\bf Moore graph} is a connected graph with 
maximal girth $2d+1$ for its diameter $d$.

It can be shown that Moore graphs are regular, i.e.\ all vertices have the
same valency. So a Moore graph is characterised by its diameter and valency.

\clearpage
\subsection*{Moore graphs with $d=1$, $g=3$}

Diameter 1 means every vertex (node) is adjacent to every other, that is, a
complete graph. Indeed, complete graphs $K_n$ that have cycles ($n\ge3$) have
triangles, so the girth is 3 and they are Moore graphs. Every valency $v\ge2$
occurs ($K_n$ has valency $n-1$).

\clearpage
\subsection*{Moore graphs with $d=2$, $g=5$}

This is the most interesting case. And \PMlinkid{the proof}{6948} that every vertex has the same valency, $v$ say, and that the graph now has $n=v^2+1$ vertices in all, is easy here.

With some more work, it can be shown there are only 4 possible values for $v$
and $n$:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|l|}
   $v$ & $n$ & graph                        \\\hline
                                              \hline
    2  &    5  & pentagon                   \\\hline
    3  &   10  & Petersen graph             \\\hline
    7  &   50  & Hoffman--Singleton graph   \\\hline
   57  & 3250  & \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ???  \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The first three cases each have a unique solution. The existence or otherwise of
the last case is still \PMlinkid{open}{6331}. It has been shown that if it exists it has, unlike the first three, very little symmetry.

The Hoffman--Singleton graph is a bit hard to draw. Here's a unified
description of the three known Moore graphs of $d=2$, all indices (mod~5):
%
\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Pentagon:} five vertices, which we can label $P^{\vphantom0}_k$.

      Each $P^{\vphantom0}_k$ is connected by two edges
      to $P^{\vphantom0}_{k\pm1}$.

\item {\bf Petersen:} ten vertices, which we can label
      $P^{\,\circ}_k$ and $P^{\,\star}_k$.

      Each $P^{\,\circ}_k$ is connected by two edges to $P^{\,\circ}_{k\pm1}$
      and by one to $P^{\,\star}_{2k}$.

      Each $P^{\,\star}_k$ is connected by two edges to $P^{\,\star}_{k\pm1}$
      and by one to $P^{\,\circ}_{3k}$.

\item {\bf Hoffman--Singleton:} fifty vertices, which we can label
      $P^{\,\circ}_{n,k}$ and $P^{\,\star}_{m,k}$.

      Each $P^{\,\circ}_{n,k}$ is connected by two edges
      to $P^{\,\circ}_{n,k\pm1}$
      and by five to $P^{\,\star}_{m,mn+2k}$ for all $m$.

      Each $P^{\,\star}_{m,k}$ is connected by two edges
      to $P^{\,\star}_{m,k\pm1}$
      and by five to $P^{\,\circ}_{n,2mn+3k}$ for all $n$.

\end{itemize}
%
The automorphism group of the pentagon is the dihedral group with 10 elements. The one of the Petersen graph is isomorphic to $S_5$, with 120 elements. And the one of the HS graph is isomorphic to $\hbox{PSU}(3,5)\cdot 2$, with 252\,000 elements, a maximal subgroup of another HS, the Higman-Sims group.

\clearpage
\subsection*{Moore graphs with $d\ge3$, $g\ge7$}

In these cases, there are only Moore graphs with valency 2, graphs
consisting of a single $2d+1$-gon cycle. This was proven independently by
Bannai and Ito and by Damerell.
